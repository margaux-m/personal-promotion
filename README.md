# Personal Promotion Website

Personal Promotion is a service offering personalised social media campaigns on Youtube, Facebook, Instagram and Spotify for singer/musician artists.🎵🎸

## What it is made with🎨👩‍💻

Personal Promotion's website is a simple static website, working as a landing page and made with HTML5, CSS3. I also used [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons and [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) for the contact form. I deployed it using GitHub Pages. For images like the logo, I used Figma. The website is available in two languages.

### The content

- Two pages: one in English, one in French
- Navigation bar with call-to-action redirecting to the contact section
- Hero banner with linear gradient and a background image
- Introductory text section with a customed ordered list
- Text section with a grid layout to display blocks of text plus image
- Contact section with a contact form working with [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) and customed with CSS
- Footer with logo, contact info and Facebook icon

All fully responsive to diverse screen sizes.📱
