    <p>
      The goal of Personal Promotion is to provide each customer with an adapted, personally
      designed PR service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specialised in YouTube and Facebook marketing (but we also run campaigns for Instagram,
      Spotify, ...), Personal Promotion has something to offer for every type of budget and
      expectations.
    </p>
    <h2>Get personalised YouTube, Spotify and social media campaigns</h2>
    <p>
      In my opinion, there's no worse feeling for an artist looking for promotion than finding
      themselves face to face with a marketing page full of packs (XXX $ = XXX Views/Streams).
      Why am I saying that?
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li class="numbered-list">
        As there's no human interaction (since all you do is to choose for a pack and then
        proceed to payment), you don't know who you are working with, how these people actually
        run the campaigns...
      </li>
      <li class="numbered-list">
        There's absolutely no guarantee that the views, streams or followers you'll gain are real.
        Ultimately, fake views on YouTube are usually deleted by YouTube, fake streams on Spotify
        can lead to having your song removed from the platform and fake followers can lead to your
        Facebook / Instagram account being banned.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      THIS IS WHY I decided to do it the other way around. Instead of providing a very detailed
      website full of options, I'm just going to leave you my email adress so we can get in touch
      in case you're interested!

  <!-- How I Work section -->
  <div class="container container-tools">
    <h1>How I work</h1>
    <p class="tools-intro">
      As a PR, I know how getting heard on radios is tough and unfair. But when it comes to
      YouTube, Facebook and the rest of digital marketing, I have developed several tools that
      never happened to fail.
    </p>
    <div class="tool">
      <div>
        <h2 class="tool-title">YouTube</h2>
        <p>
          Having ran more campaigns than a human brain could even remember, I know exactly how to
          set up each campaign to get a certain result. Hence, I am able to offer you high quality
          views for a very low price.  BUT, the most important part is that you will get many
          interactions from these views, since your music will be presented to a public that likes
          your musical genre.  You will definitely gain followers, likes (and dislikes, because
          it's organic) and comments from the campaigns! Which means that the next time you'll
          post a song, those acquired followers are very likely to interact again with your new
          content... So, in a way, the ultimate goal would be for you to gain so many organic
          followers that you'll never need Personal Promotion to run a campaign for you again. ðŸ˜‰

        <p>
          The focus is on triggering the Spotify algorithm and on increasing your followers.
          This way, you will not only get streams for a limited period of time (the duration
          of the campaign) but you'll develop an audience for all of your current and future
          releases.
